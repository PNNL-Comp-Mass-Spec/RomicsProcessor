\usage{
romicsFilterVariable(
  romics_object,
  ANOVA_filter = "p",
  p = 0.05,
  variable_names = "none",
  statCol = "none",
  statCol_filter = "<=0.05",
  statCol2 = "none",
  statCol2_filter = "<=0.05",
  mode = "keep"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{ANOVA_filter}{Either 'none', 'p' or 'padj'. Indicates if an the ANOVA filter has to be used to plot the Heatmap (only the proteins below the filter will be displayed on the heatmap)}

\item{p}{Numerical of length 1 indicating the value of the ANOVA_filter cutoff (anything below this value will be conserved).}

\item{variable_names}{A character vector that enable to filter based on the names of the variables, if variable_name set to 'none' the filter won't be applied.}

\item{statCol}{A column contained in the statistical layer of the romics_object, the list of columns can be obtained by using the function romicsCalculatedStats().}

\item{statCol_filter}{Character to indicate how this column should be filtered (e.g. '<=0.05','>0.05','==1', '==TRUE', '>2')}

\item{statCol2}{A column contained in the statistical layer of the romics_object, the list of columns can be obtained by using the function romicsCalculatedStats().}

\item{statCol2_filter}{Character to indicate how this column should be filtered (e.g. '<=0.05','>0.05','==1', '==TRUE', '>2')}

\item{mode}{Either 'keep' or 'drop' to indicate if the variable should be kept or droped based on the filters.}
