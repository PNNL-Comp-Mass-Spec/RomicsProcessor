\usage{
romicsTrend(
  romics_object,
  factor = "main",
  log_factor = FALSE,
  type = "both",
  p = 0.05
)
}
\arguments{
\item{romics_object}{has to be a romics_object created using the function romicsCreateObject() (see dedicated documentation) and has to be numeric.}

\item{factor}{has to be a factor contained in the romics_object created, the list of factor can be extracted using the function romicsFactorNames() (see dedicated documentation)}

\item{log_factor}{Boolean, indicate if the factor needs to be log transformed (TRUE), or not (FALSE). By default the factor is not transformed}

\item{type}{indicates if linear and/or quadratic trends analysis have to be performed, has to be 'both', 'linear',or 'quadratic'.}

\item{p}{indicates the minimal fitting p-value to be considered.}
}
\value{
This function returns a romics_object with new columns in the stat layer corresponding to the best fitting model, and the linear and/or quadratic p-values
}
\description{
This function extract the linear and quadratic trend pvalues and direction based on the pvalue it attributes the best fitted trend
}
\details{
This function allows to calculate the linear and quadratic p value and estimate the best fitting model
}
