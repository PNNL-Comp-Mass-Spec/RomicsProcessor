# RomicsProcessor

RomicsProcessor is an R package that can be used to store and analyze omics data.
The package provides a structured R object to store the data, allowing for reproducible
data analysis. The package also supports creating analytical pipelines from 
previously processed objects and applying these pipeline to other objects.
This allows for rapid development and reuse of bioinformatics methods.
