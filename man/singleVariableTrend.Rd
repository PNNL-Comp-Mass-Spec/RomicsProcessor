\usage{
singleVariableTrend(
  romics_object,
  variable = "variable",
  factor = "main",
  log_factor = FALSE,
  title = "auto"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{romics_object}{has to be a romics_object created using the function romicsCreateObject() (see dedicated documentation) and has to be numeric.}

\item{variable}{has to be a character vector. Romics will try to find an exact match or a partial match of the variable in the analytes names (colnames(romics_object$data))}

\item{factor}{has to be a factor contained in the romics_object created, the list of factor can be extracted using the function romicsFactorNames() (see dedicated documentation)}

\item{log_factor}{Boolean, indicate if the factor needs to be log transformed (TRUE), or not (FALSE). By default the factor is not transformed}

\item{title}{this has to be a character vector, either "auto" (in this case the rowname containing the variable will be displayed as title) or a title of your choice.}
}
\value{
This function returns a list
}
\description{
This function plots the best fitted trend and a dotplot of the analytes intensities.
}
\details{
this function enables to calculate and extract the linear or quardratic trend p values and the best fitted trend (e.g. linear_increasing, linear_decreasing, quadratic_concave,quadratic_convex)
