\usage{
extractMaxQuant(
  file = "/filepath/proteinGroups.txt",
  quantification_type = "LFQ",
  cont.rm = TRUE,
  site.rm = TRUE,
  rev.rm = TRUE,
  min_peptides = 1,
  min_unique_peptides = 1,
  min_razor_peptides = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{file}{This has to be the file path and file name of the maxQuant proteinGroup.txt file from which the information has to be extracted}

\item{quantification_type}{has to be one of the following options : 'LFQ','Intensity','iBAQ','MS.MS', "TMT","TMT.corrected" Indicate what type of quantification needs to be extracted from the ProteinGroup table, can be either}

\item{cont.rm}{has to be TRUE or FALSE, indicates if the contaminant have to be removed}

\item{site.rm}{has to be TRUE or FALSE, indicates if the identification by site only have to be removed}

\item{rev.rm}{has to be TRUE or FALSE, indicates if the False Positive entries have to be removed}

\item{min_peptides}{has to be numerical, indicates the minimum number of peptides for protein imporation}
}
\value{
it will return a data.frame with a first column containing the Protein IDs as first column, the other columns will be the Quantitative columns corresponding to the quantitation mode selected.
