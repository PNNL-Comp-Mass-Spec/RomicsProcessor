romicsWilcoxTest(
  romics_object,
  alternative = "two.sided",
  paired = FALSE,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{romics_object}{has to be an romics_object created with the function romicsCreateObject(),}

\item{alternative}{a character string specifying the alternative hypothesis, must be one of "two.sided" (default), "greater" or "less". You can specify just the initial letter.}

\item{paired}{a logical indicating whether you want a paired t-test.}

\item{pairing_factor}{name of a factor contained in an r_object, the list of the available factor can be obtained by using the function romics_factors()}

\item{factor}{a character string indicating the factor to use for the test, the list of the available factor can be obtained by using the function romics_factors(), if missing the function will use the main factor of the object}

\item{padj}{a logical variable indincating wheter to perform or not adjustment of pvalues}

\item{padj_method}{correction method. Must be in  {"holm", "hochberg", "hommel", "bonferroni", "BH", "BY", "fdr","none"}}

\item{mode}{'vs' or 'enrichment' indicating if all the between group comparisons should be performed (vs) or if the features in a given group should be compared to all the other groups (enrichment).}

\item{...}{other parameters can be passed down to the wilox.test() function from the 'stat' package.}
}
\value{
an romics_object with the statistical layer containing the newly generated t.tests and fold-changes
}
\description{
Performs all possible paired Wilcoxon signed-rank test for each variable using the levels of the selected factor of the romics_object. The results are added as new columns in the statistics layers.
}
\details{
When paired Wilcox.test are performed it is possible to include a second factor to generate the pairs. This function will also calculate the fold-changes or log2(fold-change). Please, note that the test will automatically determine if a log tranformation was performed to the object, subsequently we recommend to import not pre-logged data.frames when creating the object. For paired T.tests, it is possible to set a second factor containing the pairs, if missing the function will consider the pairs based on the column order in the romics_object.
