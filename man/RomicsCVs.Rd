Calculate the CVs (works properly for non logged romics_objects only) for each level of a metadata factor and eventually plot the CV boxplot and/or barplot (on demand)}

RomicsCVs(romics_object, factor = "main", plot = "all")

\arguments{
\item{romics_object}{A romics_object created using romicsCreateObject()}

\item{factor}{A string indicating a factor from the romics_object. The factors usable for a given romics_object names can be obtain using the function romicsFactorNames(romics_object)}

romicsCVs()
Calculate the CVs (works properly for non logged romics_objects only) for each level of a metadata factor and eventually plot the CV boxplot and/or barplot (on demand)
}
\details{
This function will calculate the CVs, the percentage CVs, and on demand will plot the barplot and/or the boxplot of the CVs per sampletype. The CVs are calculated on unlogged romics_object only.
