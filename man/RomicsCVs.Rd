\usage{
RomicsCVs(romics_object, factor = "main", plot = "all")
}
\arguments{
\item{romics_object}{A romics_object created using romicsCreateObject()}

\item{factor}{A string indicating a factor from the romics_object. The factors usable for a given romics_object names can be obtain using the function romicsFactorNames(romics_object)}

\item{plot}{can be either FALSE, 'boxplot', 'barplot', or 'all'}
}
\description{
Calculates the CVs (works properly for non logged romics_objects only) for each level of a metadata factor. This function can also be used to plot the CV boxplot and/or barplot on demand. The CVs are generated in a separate object and wonâ€™t be included in the statistics layer.
}
\details{
This function will calculate the CVs, the percentage CVs, and on demand will plot the barplot and/or the boxplot of the CVs per sampletype. The CVs are calculated on unlogged romics_object only.
