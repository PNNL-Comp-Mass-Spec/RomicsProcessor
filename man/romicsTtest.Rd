\title{romicsTtest()
Perform all possible paired T.tests for a given factor based of a romics_object.}
\usage{
romicsTtest(romics_object, alternative = "two.sided", paired = FALSE,
  pairing_factor = "none", var.equal = FALSE, factor = "main",
  padj = TRUE, padj_method = "BH")
}
\arguments{
\item{romics_object}{has to be an romics_object created with the function romicsCreateObject(),}

\item{alternative}{a character string specifying the alternative hypothesis, must be one of "two.sided" (default), "greater" or "less". You can specify just the initial letter.}

\item{paired}{a logical indicating whether you want a paired t-test.}

\item{var.equal}{a logical variable indicating whether to treat the two variances as being equal. If TRUE then the pooled variance is used to estimate the variance otherwise the Welch (or Satterthwaite) approximation to the degrees of freedom is used.}

\item{factor}{a character string indicating the factor to use for the test, the list of the available factor can be obtained by using the function romics_factors(), if missing the function will use the main factor of the object}

\item{padj}{a logical variable indincating wheter to perform or not adjustment of pvalues}

\item{padj_method}{correction method. Must be in  {"holm", "hochberg", "hommel", "bonferroni", "BH", "BY", "fdr","none"}}

\item{paired_factor}{name of a factor contained in an r_object, the list of the available factor can be obtained by using the function romics_factors()}
}
\value{
an romics_object with the statistical layer containing the newly generated t.tests and fold-changes
}
\description{
romicsTtest()
Perform all possible paired T.tests for a given factor based of a romics_object.
}
\details{
When paired T.test are performed it is possible to include a second factor to generate the pairs. This function will also calculate the fold-changes or log2(fold-change). Please, note that the test will automatically determine if a log tranformation was performed to the object, subsequently we recommend to import not pre-logged data.frames when creating the object. For paired T.tests, it is possible to set a second factor containing the pairs, if missing the function will consider the pairs based on the column order in the romics_object.
