\usage{
romicsFilterMissing(romics_object, percentage_completeness = 50,
  main_factor = "main")
}
\arguments{
\item{romics_object}{A romics_object created using romicsCreateObject()}

\item{percentage_completeness}{Numerical vector indicating the minimum percentage of data to be considered}

\item{main_factor}{has to be either "main", "none" or a factor of an romics_object created using romicsCreateObject() the list of factors can be obtained by running the function romicsFactorNames() on the romics_object}
}
\value{
The function will return a filtered romics_object with the rows of the data and missing data object removed when appropriate.

}
\details{
This function will use the completeness of the protein in the overall samples (when none is used as factor), or of a given level of a specific defined factor (in this case the factor has to be set to either "main" or to the given factor of filtering). By default main_factor is the main factor of the object, the percentage_completeness is set at 50%
