\usage{
romicsUpdateSteps(romics_object, arguments)
}
\arguments{
\item{romics_object}{A romics_object created using romicsCreateObject()}

\item{arguments}{the arguments of a function are required to read the user input of a function, this user input will be used to generate the steps, the arguments are obtained by running the following code <arguments<-as.list(match.call())> in the first line of a function}
}
\value{
This function add the description of the processing to the step layer of an Romics object
}
\description{
Updates the steps of the romics_object, require to have recorded the argument in earlier steps of the function
}
\details{
The goal of Romics processor is to provide a trackable and reproducible pipeline for processing omics data. Subsequently it is necessary when a function is created to implement a way to record the user input that will be recorded in the steps layer of the Romics_object.

This function will enable to simplify the work of developers who want to contribute to Romics by simplifying this process. Only two lines of codes are then necessary to update the steps.

The first line of code has to be placed in the first line after the function declaration : <arguments<-as.list(match.call())>

The second line of code has to be <romics_object<-stepUpdater(romics_object,arguments)> placed at the end of the function code (ideally right before returning the processed romics_object or graphic generated by the function)
