\arguments{
\item{romics_object}{A romics_object created using romicsCreateObject().}

\item{color_palette}{Character vector of colors. By default the viridis(n=20) will be used}

\item{color_boundaries}{Numerical vector of length 2. Indicates the min and max of the color scale. By default will be c(-2,2)}

\item{sample_hclust}{Boolean. Indicates if hclust has to be done for the samples.}

\item{sample_hclust_method_dist}{Sample dist method to be used. This must be one of "euclidean", "maximum", "manhattan", "canberra", "binary", "minkowski", "pearson", "spearman" or "kendall".}

\item{sample_hclust_method_hclust}{Sample agglomeration method to be used. This should be (an unambiguous abbreviation of) one of "ward", "single", "complete", "average", "mcquitty", "median" or "centroid".}

\item{variable_hclust}{Boolean. Indicates if hclust has to be done for the variables.}

\item{variable_hclust_method_dist}{Variable dist method to be used. This must be one of "euclidean", "maximum", "manhattan", "canberra", "binary", "minkowski", "pearson", "spearman" or "kendall".}

\item{variable_hclust_method_hclust}{Variable agglomeration method to be used. This should be (an unambiguous abbreviation of) one of "ward", "single", "complete", "average", "mcquitty", "median" or "centroid".}

\item{variable_hclust_number}{Numerical of length 1. Indicates the number of clusters to be used for the coloring of the variable hclust}

\item{ANOVA_filter}{Either 'none', 'p' or 'padj'. Indicates if an the ANOVA filter has to be used to plot the Heatmap (only the features below the filter will be displayed on the heatmap)}

\item{p}{Numerical of length 1 indicating the value of the ANOVA_filter cutoff (anything below this value will be conserved).}

\item{statCol}{A column contained in the statistical layer of the romics_object, the list of columns can be obtained by using the function romicsCalculatedStats().}

\item{statCol_filter}{Character to indicate how this column should be filtered (e.g. '<=0.05','>0.05','==1', '==TRUE', '>2')}

\item{statCol2}{A column contained in the statistical layer of the romics_object, the list of columns can be obtained by using the function romicsCalculatedStats().}

\item{statCol2_filter}{Character to indicate how this column should be filtered (e.g. '<=0.05','>0.05','==1', '==TRUE', '>2')}

\item{notecol}{(optional) character string specifying the color for cellnote text. Defaults to "black".}

\item{density.info}{character string indicating whether to superimpose a 'histogram', a 'density' plot, or no plot ('none') on the color-key.}

\item{trace}{has to be in c("column","row","both","none"). See trace() documentation.}

\item{cexCol}{positive numbers, used as cex.axis in for the row or column axis labeling. The defaults currently only use number of columns.}

\item{key.title}{main title of the color key. If set to NA no title will be plotted.}

\item{key.xlab}{x axis label of the color key. If set to NA no label will be plotted.}

\item{RowSideColor}{character vector has to be either 'none' or a calculated statistics (ending by _p or _padj) from the romics_object}

\item{...}{parameters to send to heatmap.2}

\item{LabRow}{character vectors with row labels to use; these default to rownames(x)}

\item{margin}{numeric vector of length 2 containing the margins (see par(mar= *)) for column and row names, respectively.}
}
\value{
A heatmap generated using the gplots::heatmap.2() function. Subsequently any adjustment of the heatmap.2 can be performed as described in gplots::heatmap.2() documentation.
}
\description{
Plots a scaled heatmap of the data layer from a romics_object using the function heatmaps.2 from the package gplots. This data can (or not) be filtered based on the statistics layer of the romics_object.
}
\details{
Create a customizable and filterable heatmap based on the romics_object statistics Layer. the ANOVA filter enables to restrict the variable displayed to be only the ones passing an ANOVA

2 stat column filters (StatCol) can be set simultaneously to restrict the variable displayed. Each filter enable to sort based on a given column of the statistics layer (statCol_filter) of an romics_object (the list of columns can be obtained by using the function romicsCalculatedStats()) using a specific text (statCol_text) this text indicate what parameter should be used to filter this column (example: column has to be positive -> statCol_text= '>0'). Note that the ANOVA filter is applied first (if any) and then the filters are applied sequencially (first, then second, then third).
