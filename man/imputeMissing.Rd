\title{imputeMissing
This function enable to impute the data using a normal distribution down-shifted from the median by a user defined number of standard deviations and a user defined width.}
\usage{
imputeMissing(romics_object, nb_stdev = 1.8, width_stdev = 0.5,
  seed = 42)
}
\arguments{
\item{romics_object}{has to be an romics_object created using romicsCreateObject()}
}
\value{
The function will return a modified romics_object that will have imputed data, however the missingdata layer will conserve the location of the missingness, the missingness can subsequently be restored using the function romicsRestoreMissing().

This function enable to impute the data using a normal distribution down-shifted from the median by a user defined number of standard deviations and a user defined width.
}
\details{
This function will impute the data using the method described in the Perseus paper by Tyranova et al. 2016 (Nature Method). By default the data is imputed with values in a normal distribution 1.8 standard deviation away from the median  and a width of distribution of 0.5.
